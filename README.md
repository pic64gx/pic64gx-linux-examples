# PIC64GX SoC Linux Examples

This repository contains a number of example applications that can be used to
explore the features of the PIC64GX Curiosity Kit.
These examples will be automatically included as part of the PIC64GX Curiosity
Kit Buildroot and Yocto images, in the `/opt/microchip/` directory.
These images will contain both the source code for the examples as well as
precompiled binaries where possible.

## Hardware Requirements

PIC64GX Curiosity Kit (PIC64GX1000)

## Pre-requisites

Before running any of these example applications, set up the PIC64GX Curiosity Kit and
ensure Linux can be booted as explained in the
[PIC64GX Curiosity  Kit BSP layer Readme][1] document.
