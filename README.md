# PolarFire SoC Linux Examples

This repository contains a number of example applications that can be used to
explore the features of the icicle kit.
These examples will be automatically included as part of the Icicle kit
Buildroot and Yocto images, in the `/opt/microchip/` directory.
These images will contain both the source code for the examples as well as
precompiled binaries where possible.

## Hardware Requirements

PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit (MPFS250T-FCVG484EES)

## Pre-requisites

Before running any of these example applications, set up the Icicle kit and
ensure Linux can be booted as explained in the
[Updating PolarFire SoC Icicle-Kit FPGA Design and Linux Image][1] document.
